I'm a backwoods web developer working with <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24794769/176982227-a826cec9-ac38-4e89-8ef2-cead81ab7186.png" width="24"> Laravel and <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24794769/176982249-0eb09130-74ed-4895-b22f-845fc5132d7e.png" width="24"> Vue and waiting for the day Jesus the Christ will return.

Although I love working with Laravel and Vue, I'm interested in systems of all shapes and size! In my spare time, I like to take a few photos and sometimes do a little graphic design.

## Some of my projects

### [Auto view readme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chadonsom.auto-view-readme) vscode extension

_[Github repo](https://github.com/ChaDonSom/auto-view-readme)_

Because opening the file panel and navigating to whatever readme corresponds to the current file is too slow!

### [Laravel vite template](https://laravel-vite-template.somero.dev) template app

_[Github repo](https://github.com/ChaDonSom/laravel-vite-template)_

For spinning up a new project with all my preferred tech in a jiffy.

### [Gibberish generator app](https://chadonsom.github.io/gibberish-generator/)

_[Github repo](https://github.com/ChaDonSom/gibberish-generator)_

For playing around with parts of speech to make nonsense sentences out of randomly chosen words.
